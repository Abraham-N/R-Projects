# Correspondence Analysis {#ca}



## Introduction

Correspondence analysis (CA) turns a data table into two new variables called factor scores (one factor score is a linear combination of the rows, and the other the columns). The factor scores give the best representation of the similarity in structure of the rows and columns. Correspondence analysis maximizes the variance of the factor scores.\

## The data and pattern

Six vowels (i,y,e,a,o, and u) were shown to a set of participants and asked to associate a color (Yellow, Green, Orange, Blue, Red, and Violet) to each of them.


```r
# Get the data ----
X <- import("FrenchVowelsAndColors.csv")

# The active data set
X <- as.matrix(X)
row.names(X) <- c('i','y','e','a','o','u')
X
```

```
##   Yellow Green Orange Blue Red Violet
## i     46    17      2   11  42      5
## y     18    48      6   12   6      6
## e     17    20     13   29   4      8
## a      8     7      5   17  30      6
## o     18     9     19   19  21     10
## u      1     2     15   14  16     16
```

Computing the chi-square of the data matrix:

```r
# get Chi2 -- we can use the available package to get the Chi2
chi2    <-  chisq.test(X)
```

Chi-square is in counts, but CA analyzed probabilities (i.e., the profiles). So, we need to divide the chi-square statistics by the total sum of the data. Also, the chi-square statistic adds the chi-squares in all cells and give one number. In CA, however, we keep the pattern of chi-squares instead of adding all of them up.

```r
# Components of chi2: the chi-squares for each cell before we add them up to compute the chi2
Inertia.cells <- chi2$residuals / sqrt(sum(X))
# To be Plotted

# You can always compute it directly from the data
Z <- X / sum(X) # observed 
r <- as.matrix(rowSums(Z)) # expected for each row
c <- as.matrix(colSums(Z)) # expected for each column
# Inertia.cells 
test.Inertia.cells <- diag( as.vector(r^(-1/2)) ) %*% 
                     (Z - r%*%t(c) ) %*% diag(as.vector(c^(-1/2)))
```

## Analysis

Computing Symmetric and Asymmetric CA analysis. epCA function is used with property 'symmetric =' true or false respectively. 


```r
# run CA
resCA.sym  <- epCA(X, symmetric = TRUE, graphs = FALSE)
resCAinf.sym4bootJ  <- epCA.inference.battery(X, symmetric = TRUE, graphs = FALSE, test.iters = 25)
resCAinf.sym4bootI  <- epCA.inference.battery(t(X), symmetric = TRUE, graphs = FALSE, test.iters = 25)

# to run a plain CA but asymmetric
# this is using the columns as the simplex (you can also use rows by running epCA with t(X))
resCA.asym <- epCA(X, symmetric = FALSE, graphs = FALSE)
```

Here the inference battery is produced using function fastperm4CA, with 1000 iterations for the permutations:


```r
res_fast_perm <- data4PCCAR::fastPerm4CA(X, nIter = 1000, compact = FALSE)
res_fast_boot <- data4PCCAR::fastBoot4CA(X)
```


### Scree Plot
The results from permutation with Scree plot are shown here. The estimated p-values were added to the `PlotScree` function.

### Plot the asymmetric factor scores

Here the asymmetric plot is shown inside the convex hull for the values of the columns. Further interpretation of these results are discussed in the conclusion section of this chapter, however, we are able to interpret which letters are most attributed to which colors from this map.

### Plot the symmetric plot

Creating the symmetric plot with all labels printed. In this case, the symmetric map and asymmetric map are quite similar, and our interpretations of the relationship between colors and letters remains the same.

#### Contributions and bootstrap ratios barplots

##### Contribution barplots

Contributions for rows and columns are shown in this section. For component one row contributions, y has an important negative contribution and u has an important positive contribution. For the columns, green has an important negative contribution. For component two row contributions, i has an important negative contribution. For the columns, yellow and red have important positive contributions and green has an important negative contribution.

##### Bootstrap ratios

The bootstrap ratio plot showed many more significant contributions as shown. We can now infer that the y contribution is related to the green contribution on component one, and a, o, and u related to orange, red, and violet. For component two, i is related to yellow and red while y,e, and u are related to green, orange, blue, and violet. The contributions along with the scores plot (either symmetric or asymmetric) allow us to make some inferences of which letters were most attributed to which colors.


We then use the next line of code to put two figures side to side:

## Summary
When we interpret the factor scores and loadings together, the CA revealed:

* Do you prefer symmetric or asymmetric plot for your data?
I prefer the symmetric plot since it better shows the relationship between the variables.

* Component 1: 
Strong negative loadings:
  row: y
  column: Green
Strong positive loadings:
  row: u
  column: violet, orange, red
* Component 2:
Strong negative loadings:
  row: e
  column: blue, green, violet, orange
Strong positive loadings:
  row: i
  column: yellow, red

* Both: 
  The colors orange, blue, and violet mostly described the letters a,o,u, and e.
  The colors green, yellow, and red mostly described the letters i and y.
